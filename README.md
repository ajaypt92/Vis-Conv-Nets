# VisConvNets
This is a personal project for the purpose of understanding Convolution networks with visualizations of intermediate Convolution and Activation layers. 

I have used the following dataset https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition for training my InceptionV3 model.

You can use create_train_val_test.py to create Training, Validation and Test directories out of original datasets. After that you can just run model_training_and_visualization.py to train the model and produce all the visualizations shown in my blog post. Note that the images might differ depending on what test image you are using and how your network is trained.

Although I have tried to explain my code with comments, but for any issues you can just create a Issue and I'll try to resolve it. I have taken the code inspiration from the book Deep Learning in Python by Francois Chollet. I highly recommend for everybody to read this book espeicially if you are new to the field.
